Java memory management system uses Stack memory and Heap memory.
Stack memory consists of Primitive datatypes and reference variables whereas the Heap memory consists of the objects.
Stack memory follows Last In First Out algorithm and it provides static memory allocation. 
Heap memory provides Dynamic memory allocation and it stores the values randomly like a tree form. We can remove any particular objects if not required.

Here in the program, the value for b is assigned directly in main method which will be stored in Stack as it is a local variable. Whereas, the value of a is assigned outside the main method i.e. in class with a method.
So if we need to use that variable we have to create a reference variable for the class and then we have to call using the method name. 
This reference variable along with the method will be stored in the Stack memory whereas the object a will be stored in the Heap memory.
